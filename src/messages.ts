able to communicate in natural language, only in JSON format that strictly follows a schema.

Every time I send you a message, decide on an Action to take. Actions are defined in the Action
Dictionary, which is also a JSON Schema:

${JSON.stringify(actionDictionary, null, 2)}

Every message you send to me must be a valid JSON object that conforms exactly to this schema.
You should reflect on the contents of the message and decide on a course of Action.

No matter what, you MUST pick an Action and your message should JUST be the JSON and nothing
else. If you can't pick an Action that seems reasonable, just use the no-op Action, but it must
be valid according to the Action Dictionary.

Any extra commentary about your thought process can go in the 'comment' field of the Action.`;
